## Project Overview
As our energy sources are limited, efficiency is the key for sustainability. In order to be efficient in our houses, we are building smart ones, but the existent ones remain the same. We tried to come up with solution to make our homes smarter in lighting.
This project's main aim is not just to be efficient in homes' lighting but also be cost effective as well, so we tried to build from ground cost effectively.
